# Main folder

The **main** folder contains all the scripts, datasets, splits, best hyperparameters, and model files for the primary QuantumPioneer dataset used to compare the `rigr`, `native`, and `native+aug` models, as discussed in our [work](). Files for all training dataset sizes are included for both random and K-means splits.

We recommend downloading the entire main folder to your local system and using the appropriate chemprop branch (as per the [branch guide](https://github.com/akshatzalte/chemprop/tree/rigr_home?tab=readme-ov-file#branch-guide)) to reproduce all the results from our work.
