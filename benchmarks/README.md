# RIGR Benchmarks

This directory contains all the scripts, splits, best hyperparameters, and model files for all RIGR benchmarks. The general `rigr_charge` branch is used for all benchmarks except RGD1 reaction barrier benchmark where we use the `rigr_charge_stereo_chiral` branch. The benchmarks include all datasets used for benchmarking Chemprop v2 described in its latest article: [Chemprop v2.0 Temporary Title](). All the datasets and splits can be found [here](https://zenodo.org/records/10078142).

## Timing Benchmark

Training time and memory comparison between RIGR and Native+Augmentation can be found in the [timing](./timing) folder.
