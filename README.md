**Implements `rigr` as a flag**

Use the RIGR featurizer in CLI by adding `--rigr` to train (and infer) your chemprop models. Optionally, depending on your dataset and task, you can use additional molecular charge and multiplicity features. See [rigr_home](https://github.com/akshatzalte/chemprop/tree/rigr_home) for more information. For notebook users, refer to our [example notebook](https://github.com/akshatzalte/chemprop/blob/rigr_flag/notebooks/rigr_flag_notebook.ipynb).
