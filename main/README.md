The **main** folder contains all the scripts, datasets, splits, best hyperparameters, and model files for the primary QuantumPioneer dataset used to compare the `rigr`, `native`, and `native+aug` models, as discussed in our [work](). For both random and K-means splits, files for all training dataset sizes are included.
